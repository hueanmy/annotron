# annotron — Markdown preview, Mermaid diagrams & point‑and‑click review

**Preview Markdown and HTML with live Mermaid diagrams, then click to comment.** Right‑click any `.md` or `.html` file → **Open in annotron** → review it point‑and‑click in your browser: comment on any element or text selection, render `mermaid` diagrams, edit the Markdown source and **Save** to re‑render, and (optionally) drive an AI‑agent feedback loop.

## Features

- 📝 **Markdown preview** — render `.md` to a clean, readable document (tables, code, blockquotes, everything).
- 📐 **Mermaid diagrams** — `flowchart`, `sequence diagram`, `class diagram`, `ER diagram`, `C4`, `gantt`, `gitGraph` and more render to **inline SVG** (via [merslim](https://www.npmjs.com/package/merslim)) — no client‑side diagram runtime, perfect for **architecture docs** and **UML**.
- 🖱️ **Point‑and‑click annotation & review** — select text or click an element to comment; each comment carries the exact selector + text, so feedback is precise. Threads, resolve/reply, and reviewer identity (your GitHub account) included.
- 💾 **Two‑way Markdown sync** — edit the Markdown source in a side pane and **Save** (⌘/Ctrl+S) to write it back and re‑render (diagrams included). The `.md` stays the source of truth.
- 🤖 **AI‑agent loop (optional)** — send structured feedback to your coding agent, watch its activity live, and approve tool permissions from the browser.
- 🌐 **HTML too** — review any rendered `.html` artifact the same way.

## Usage

- **Explorer / editor right‑click** → *Open in annotron* (on `.md` / `.html`).
- **Open With…** → *annotron* — Ctrl/Cmd‑click a `.md`/`.html` file → **Open With…** → **annotron** opens the review UI right inside a VS Code editor tab. annotron is offered as an option and never overrides your default editor.
- **Command Palette** → `annotron: Open in annotron` (uses the active editor's file).
- `annotron: Stop annotron server` shuts the background server down.

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `annotron.port` | `7321` | Port the bundled server listens on (`127.0.0.1`). |
| `annotron.openIn` | `browser` | `browser` (external default browser) or `vscode` (a Simple Browser tab). |
| `annotron.autoAgent` | `true` | On open, also start an agent that **auto-applies your feedback** with Claude Code (`claude`) in a terminal. Turn off to review without an agent. |

## Agent loop & loop engineering

**Loop engineering** is the practice of building a tight feedback cycle between human reviewers and AI agents. annotron automates this entirely—no wiring needed.

### Auto-apply feedback (agent loop)

With `annotron.autoAgent` on (default), opening a file launches an **annotron agent** in a terminal that:
- 👁️ Watches for your annotations (comments on elements, text, or the full document)
- 🔄 Polls continuously for feedback
- 🤖 Runs Claude Code to apply changes to the source
- 📝 Replies with a summary of edits made
- 🔁 Repeats until you're done

So *Send feedback* → applied edits → live preview update in seconds. Requires `claude` CLI on your PATH.

### Manual agent control

Prefer finer control? Turn `annotron.autoAgent` off and drive it yourself:

```bash
# Open in annotron
annotron design.md

# In another terminal, run the agent manually
annotron agent design.md            # auto-poll & apply feedback
# or
annotron poll design.md             # one-shot: wait for feedback
annotron poll design.md --reply "…" # reply with a status message
```

## Why annotron: human-in-the-loop for AI agents

**The problem:** Reviewing agent-generated docs (PRDs, tech designs, architecture diagrams, mockups) by describing changes in prose is slow and lossy. "Change this paragraph" → agent guesses what you meant → you repeat.

**The solution:** **Loop engineering with annotron**. You **point at exactly what to change** (click an element, select text, add a note), annotron sends structured feedback to the agent, the agent applies it, and you see the result live — close the **agent feedback loop** in seconds instead of minutes. Precise feedback in, precise edits out.

### What loop engineering means in annotron

1. **Integrated agent loop** — no manual wiring (`annotron --agent` starts it automatically)
2. **Structured feedback** — each annotation carries the CSS selector, selected text, and your note; images attach too
3. **Live activity mirror** — watch the agent's tool calls (Read/Edit/Bash) stream into the sidebar
4. **Instant preview updates** — file changes → browser reloads → you see edits immediately
5. **Continuous cycle** — repeat until both agree; then finalize

## How it works

The extension bundles annotron and starts it with VS Code's own Node runtime
(`ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE`) — **no global install required**. The server renders the
file, injects the review UI into the browser only (never to disk, never to your
agent), and drives the annotation / feedback loop.
